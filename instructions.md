I need to create programming assignments 1 in assignments/pa1/ (folder where this file is) that's been added as a submodule. I've moved the class assignments off of github classroom and are just having students download the starter code as a zip to start the assignment and linking them to a public github repo where they can create codespaces or clone the starter code. To submit they can run a special command `tar -czf /workspace/pa0-NAME.zip /workspace` in the container to get a zip they can download and then upload to kodiak, or they can right click and compress the folder to a zip on their host system.  I'd like to create this programming assignment based on the @"assignments/pa1/Analysis of simple algorithms.pdf" example assignment from last year. Algorithm 1-5 should be the main questions where students have to provide the function for the number of statements (lines) executed but I also want to give the students basic java & python versions of the psudocode algorithms they can run to see how the code performs on basic inputs. Be sure to checkout assignments/pa0 so that the java code is run/tested in a similar manner to the previous assignment. I'm not really sure if we'll need unit tests for this assignment however...
